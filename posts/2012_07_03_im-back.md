I'm back.
===

Hi everyone. I'm back from my Internet hiatus. Sorry for not being around the last couple of months, I shall explain.

I joined a social networking startup early this year. Unfortunately it didn't work out, and I left in April. I had worked in web startups before, but this was the first time I had not been kept on. It's not a great experience to go through, but it was an important one.

What I did next

I took a break for a bit and caught up with family & friends. It gave me a chance to think about what to do next. I didn't want to go straight back into work, I wanted to redeem myself first...

So I built [Dashku](https://dashku.com).

Dashku is a web application that let's you build real-time dashboards and widgets for monitoring anything you like.

I've spent the last 2 and half months working on it, isolating myself from all forms of social media (hence the hiatus), and concentrating fully on it.

How it went

I launched the app last Friday. It went to the top of Hacker News (within 45 minutes). Then the server went down on an issue with ulimit, then I fixed it. The app hovered around the top 3, and stayed on the front page until Saturday morning. 

Before the HN post, it had 128 users. Today (Tuesday), it has over 5,000 users. 

Thanks to everyone who Tweeted about it, gave it a try, and said great things about it. Now I'm going to go get a job.
