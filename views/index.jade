    h1 I'm back.


    p Hi everyone. I'm back from my Internet hiatus. Sorry for not being around the last couple of months, I shall explain.
    
    p I joined a social networking startup early this year. Unfortunately it didn't work out, and I left in April. I had worked in web startups before, but this was the first time I had not been kept on. It's not a great experience to go through, but it was an important one.

    h2 What I did next

    p I took a break for a bit and caught up with family & friends. It gave me a chance to think about what to do next. I didn't want to go straight back into work, I wanted to redeem myself first...

    p... So I built <a href="https://dashku.com">Dashku</a>.

    p Dashku is a web application that let's you build real-time dashboards and widgets for monitoring anything you like.

    p I've spent the last 2 and half months working on it, isolating myself from all forms of social media (hence the hiatus), and concentrating fully on it.

    h2 How it went

      img(src="/images/hn.png", width="480px", alt="HackerNews frontpage Friday 29th June 2012")

    p I launched the app last Friday. It went to the top of Hacker News (within 45 minutes). Then the server went down on an issue with ulimit, then I fixed it. The app hovered around the top 3, and stayed on the front page until Saturday morning. 

    p Before the HN post, it had 128 users. Today (Tuesday), it has over 5,000 users. 

    p Thanks to everyone who Tweeted about it, gave it a try, and said great things about it. Now I'm going to go get a job.
