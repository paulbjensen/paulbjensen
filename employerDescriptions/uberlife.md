- Joined Uberlife, a location-aware social network.
- Added features to Uberlife as well as fixing bugs, and identifying issues with the application's architecture and infrastructure.
- Wrote the application's first integration tests with Cucumber.
- Was not kept on past the joining probation period. The reason given was that I was not delivering features as fast as they wanted.
- Uberlife was shut down, and the company focussed on their existing social network called City Socialising (now City Socializer).
